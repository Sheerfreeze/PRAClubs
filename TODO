Todo for PRAClubs:
1. Regenerate results after each student submission, (rather than after every results request).
2. Add some type synonyms and comment and clean. Beautify code.
3. Add an admin page
  * Require an admin password to access controls.
  * Allow admins to: Lock results (prevent new student entries), Change club names + their min and max sizes, update admin password, reset all student data, and manually change/update entries.
4. Change the storage format of the clubs, students, and results to YAML.
5. Add a config.yaml file. Store all configuration in this file, and have the admin page modify this file. Store this config data in the App type.
