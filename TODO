TODO for PRAClubs:
1. Abstact seperate pages into seperate haskell files (Also, move all non-main hs files to a new directory).
2. Update combobox form so there is no need for tuple lists (See 1.4 Yesod Book and update all code to be as fresh and concise as possible). 
3. Add an admin page
  * Require an admin password to access controls.
  * Allow admins to: Change club names + their min and max sizes, update admin password, reset all student data, and manually change/update entries.
4. Authenticate each user and allow each user to submit their choices only once.
5. Change the storage format of the clubs, students, and results to YAML.
6. Regenerate results after each student submission, (rather than after every results request).
